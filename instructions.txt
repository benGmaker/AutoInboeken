Instructions:
1. Copy and paste bookings into an Excel file named with the date, and set the bookings as done on the website.
2. Fill in the Excel file name into the command prompt bellow and press enter
3. Check if the booking goes correctly. If anything goes WRONG: press CTRL + C in the command prompt.
4. Watch out for any users which are incorrectly seen as unknown clients
5. Keep in mind that the code only checks for popups before and after filling in data, not whilst filling in.

In case something goes wrong:
1. In case that something goes wrong you can check which actions have been taken in the command prompt
2. If you want to redo any bookings remove them from the logbook, otherwise these will be skipped (by design)
3. Call the penno, or if the code is broken contact the Chairman and Editor-in-Chief of the 66th Board
